=head1 NAME

DateTime::Format::IBeat - Format times in .beat notation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

No Time Zones

No Geographical Borders

How long is a Swatch .beat? In short, we have divided up the virtual and
real day into 1000 I<beats>. One Swatch beat is the equivalent of 1
minute 26.4 seconds. That means that 12 noon in the old time system is
the equivalent of @500 Swatch .beats.

Okay, so how can a surfer in New York, or a passenger on a transatlantic
flight know when it is @500 Swatch .beats in Central Europe for example?
How can the New York surfer make a date for a chat with his cyber friend
in Rome? Easy, Internet Time is the same all over the world.(see
converter)

How is this possible? We are not just creating a new way of measuring
time, we are also creating a new meridian in Biel, Switzerland, home of
Swatch.

Biel MeanTime (BMT) is the universal reference for Internet Time. A day
in Internet Time begins at midnight BMT (@000 Swatch .beats) (Central
European Wintertime). The meridian is marked for all to see on the
faÃ§ade of the Swatch International Headquarters on Jakob-Staempfli
Street, Biel, Switzerland. So, it is the same time all over the world,
be it night or day, the era of time zones has disappeared.

The BMT meridian was inaugurated on 23 October 1998 in the presence of
Nicholas Negroponte, founder and director of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology`s Media Laboratory.

=head1 PARSING METHODS

=head2 parse_time

Parses a .beat time and returns a DateTime object.
The object uses the current date for its date and will have
UTC set as its timezone. Feel free to use 'set' to convert
to your local time.

    my $first = DateTime::Format::IBeat->parse_time( '@765' );
    print $first->datetime; # 2003-04-01T17:21:36

    $first->set_time_zone( "Australia/Sydney" );
    print $first->datetime; # 2003-04-02T03:21:36

B<Note> that the leading @ is optional. Also, if using direct strings,
and leading @s, be careful to not have it interpolate it as an array by
accident.

=cut

sub _beat_convert
{
    my $beats = shift;
    my $dt = shift;
    $beats /= $ratio;

    $dt ||= DateTime->now( time_zone => '+0100' )->set(
	hour => 0,
	minute => 0,
	second => 0,
    );

    $dt->add( seconds => $beats );

    return $dt->set_time_zone( 'UTC' );
};

sub _date_convert
{
    my ($day, $month, $year) = @_;
    my $dt = DateTime->new(
	time_zone => '+0100',
	year => $year + 2000,
	month => $month,
	day => $day
    )->set_time_zone( 'UTC' );

    return $dt;
};

my $beat_RE = qr/ @? (\d{1,3}) /x;
my $date_RE = qr/ @? d? (\d\d) \. (\d\d) \. (\d\d) /x;

sub _get_beats
{
    my ( $string ) = @_;
    croak "Could not parse time!" unless defined $string
        and $string =~ m/^ $beat_RE $/x;
    return $1;
};

sub _get_days
{
    my ( $string ) = @_;
    croak "Could not parse date!" unless defined $string
        and $string =~ /^ $date_RE $/x;
    return ( $1, $2, $3 );
};

sub parse_time
{
    my ( $class, $string ) = @_;
    return _beat_convert( _get_beats( $string ) );
}

=head2 parse_date

Parses an .beat date and returns a C<DateTime> object representing that date.

     my $dt = DateTime::Format::IBeat->parse_date('@d01.04.03');
     print $dt->ymd('.'); # "2003.04.01"

Note: this assumes the number of .beats elapsed in the day to be 0, thus
it will appear to be returning the day before. If you display a full
time with it, you will find it's at UTC rather than BMT (+0100), thus
11pm the day before. The important thing to remember is that it is an
accurate conversion to the usual notation, despite appearances.

=cut

sub parse_date
{
    my ( $class, $string ) = @_;
    return _date_convert( _get_days( $string ) );
}

=head2 parse_datetime

Parses an ibeat datetime string and returns a C<DateTime> object representing
that datetime.

    my $dt = DateTime::Format::IBeat->parse_datetime(
	'@d01.04.03 @765');
    print $dt->datetime; # "2003-04-01T17:21:36"

=cut

sub parse_datetime
{
    my ( $class, $string ) = @_;
    croak "Could not parse datetime!" unless defined $string;
    my ( $date, $time ) = split /\s+/, $string, 2;

    return _beat_convert( _get_beats( $time ),
        _date_convert( _get_days( $date ) ) );
}


=head1 FORMATTING METHODS

=head2 format_time

Given a DateTime object, returns a string representating that time
in ibeats.

=cut

sub format_time
{
    my $class = shift;
    my $dt = $_[0]->clone->set_time_zone( '+0100' );
    my ($hour, $min, $sec) = map { $dt->$_ } qw( hour minute second );
    my $beats = $ratio * ( 3600 * $hour + 60 * $min + $sec );
    return sprintf "@%03d", $beats;
}

=head2 format_date

Given a DateTime object, returns a string representating that date.

=cut

sub format_date
{
    my $class = shift;
    my $dt = $_[0]->clone->set_time_zone( '+0100' );
    return $dt->strftime('@d%d.%m.%y');
}

=head2 format_datetime

Given a Datetime object, returns a string representating that
date and time in .beats format.

=cut

sub format_datetime
{
    my $s = shift;
    my $c = shift;
    return $s->format_date($c).' '.$s->format_time($c);
}

=head1 THANKS

Dave Rolsky (DROLSKY) for kickstarting the DateTime project.

Swatch, for coming up with this mad format.

Jerub, from opn, who wrote the python original, from which I
retain no code. D'oh.

=head1 SUPPORT

Support for this module is provided via the datetime@perl.org email
list. See http://lists.perl.org/ for more details.

Alternatively, log them via the CPAN RT system via the web or email:

    http://perl.dellah.org/rt/dtibeat
    bug-datetime-format-ibeat@rt.cpan.org

This makes it much easier for me to track things and thus means
your problem is less likely to be neglected.
